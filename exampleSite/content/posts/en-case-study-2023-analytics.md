## Context
A fictional analytics rollout across multiple teams.

## Approach
- Start with a pilot on one team.
- Ship smallest useful slice: daily active events.
- Add dashboards for product, marketing, and ops.

## Lessons
- Instrumentation must be boring and consistent.
- Sample and aggregate early to cut noise.
- Train teams with real questions, not features.

## Outcome
Better visibility, faster triage, and clearer release criteria.
